Forked a repository from Clarity Coder Youtube channel to beat the game Fast Words. In the game Fast Words you are given a word and you must click the letters as they fall down the screen to speel the word. If you spell the word correctly a new word is given and the cycle repeats.

Hereâ€™s a dandy lil image to show you what the game looks like:

# How to work the program

---

Begin a game and intentionally lose to bring up the retry button. From here you can run the code by typing in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will run and the program will read the given word and start clicking tiles in order to spell the word.
